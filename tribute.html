      <h2 align="center" class="intro-title">Who was Mother Theresa?</h2>
      <p class="introduction">
        Mother Teresa (1910â€“1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life
        to serving the poor and destitute around the world. She spent many years
        in Calcutta, India where she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a
        religious congregation devoted to helping those in great need. In 1979,
        Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became a symbol of
        charitable, selfless work. In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised by the
        Roman Catholic Church as Saint Teresa.
